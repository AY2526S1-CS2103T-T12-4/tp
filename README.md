## Introduction

AbsolutSin-ema is a **desktop app for party planners** to manage their contacts efficiently.  
It is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while also providing a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with JavaFX.  
It is written in **Java** (~10k LoC) and is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project.

## Overview

* This is **a project for Software Engineering (SE) students**, built as part of the CS2103T module.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a contact management tool for **party planners** (e.g., wedding coordinators, film club organizers)
  * as a starting point for teams to practice **software engineering best practices**
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AbsolutSin-ema_) used for managing contacts and event-related information.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-structured** code base (around 10 KLoC) that students can extend with new features while following good SE practices.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation** to support both users and future developers.
* It is named `AbsolutSin-ema` because it is a **brownfield extension** of the AddressBook-Level3 project, repurposed for the event planning domain.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Project Website](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-t12-4.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is **based on the AddressBook-Level3** project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
