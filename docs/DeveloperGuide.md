### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of **AbsolutSin-ema**, a specialized contact management application designed for party planners to manage vendors, clients, and events efficiently.

**AbsolutSin-ema** is built on a **dual-entity system** that manages both **Persons** (vendors/clients) and **Events** (parties) with sophisticated relationship management, budget tracking, and assignment capabilities.

### Core Design Principles

1. **Domain-Specific Design**: Built specifically for party planning with vendor management, budget tracking, and event-person assignments
2. **Dual-Entity Architecture**: Separate but interconnected management of Persons and Events
3. **Budget-Aware Operations**: All assignments and operations consider budget constraints
4. **Robust Relationship Management**: PersonId system ensures data integrity across relationships
5. **Command-Driven Workflow**: CLI-first design optimized for power users

### Main Components

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) handles app launch and shutdown:
* Initializes components in correct sequence and connects them
* Manages application lifecycle and graceful shutdown
* Handles configuration and logging initialization

The application's core functionality is delivered through four main components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The user interface layer
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): Command processing and business logic
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Data models and business rules
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Data persistence and retrieval

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) provides shared utilities used across components.

### Component Interaction

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact for the command `assign 1 c/2,3` (assigning contacts 2 and 3 to event 1):

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each component:
* Defines its API in an `interface` with the same name as the Component
* Implements functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class
* Interacts with other components through interfaces to maintain loose coupling

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Component Details**

### UI Component

**API**: [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` containing specialized components:

**Core UI Components:**
* `CommandBox`: Handles CLI input with validation and auto-completion hints
* `ResultDisplay`: Shows command results and error messages
* `PersonListPanel`: Displays vendor/client contacts with tags and budget info
* `EventListPanel`: Shows events/parties with participant counts and budget status
* `StatusBarFooter`: Displays application state and file save status
* `HelpWindow`: Comprehensive help system with scrollable command reference

**Key UI Features:**
* **Dual-panel design**: Separate views for persons and events
* **Budget visualization**: Color-coded budget indicators in both panels
* **Tag-based filtering**: Visual tag representation for quick identification
* **Real-time updates**: Observable list bindings ensure immediate UI updates
* **Responsive layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes and window states

The UI uses JavaFX framework with FXML layouts stored in `src/main/resources/view`. Each UI component inherits from `UiPart<T>` which provides common functionality for GUI elements.

### Logic Component

**API**: [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's the class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

**Command Processing Flow:**

1. `LogicManager` receives user input and delegates to `AddressBookParser`
2. `AddressBookParser` creates appropriate `XYZCommandParser` based on command word
3. Parser validates input and creates `XYZCommand` object
4. `LogicManager` executes command with `Model` interaction
5. Command returns `CommandResult` with success/error information

**Specialized Parsers:**

* `AddEventCommandParser`: Handles complex event creation with optional contact assignments
* `AssignContactToEventCommandParser`: Manages bulk contact-to-event assignments with budget validation
* `FindCommandParser`: Supports both name and tag-based searching
* `EditCommandParser` / `EditEventCommandParser`: Handle partial updates with validation

**Advanced Features:**
* **Budget validation**: Commands validate budget constraints before execution
* **Undo system**: Commands save state for undo functionality via `model.saveStateForUndo()`
* **Index validation**: Robust checking of user-provided indexes against current filtered lists
* **Confirmation flows**: Multi-step commands like `clear` require confirmation

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

### Model Component

**API**: [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

**Core Model Classes:**

**`AddressBook`**: Central data container managing both persons and events
* `UniquePersonList`: Maintains person data with duplicate prevention
* `UniqueEventList`: Manages events with name-based uniqueness checking
* Deep copying mechanisms for undo functionality

**`Person`**: Represents vendors/clients with specialized fields
* `PersonId`: Unique identifier for relationship management
* `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`: Standard contact information
* `Website`: Vendor-specific field for online presence
* `Budget`: Vendor service cost for budget calculations
* `Set<Tag>`: Flexible categorization system

**`Event`**: Represents parties/gatherings with comprehensive management
* `EventName`, `EventDate`, `EventTime`: Basic event information
* `List<PersonId>`: Participants assigned to the event
* `Budget initialBudget`: Total budget allocated for the event
* `Budget remainingBudget`: Budget remaining after assignments

**Advanced Model Features:**

1. **Budget Management System:**
   ```java
   // Budget validation during assignment
   if (eventBudget < personBudget) {
       throw new CommandException("Budget exceeded");
   }
   remainingBudget = eventBudget - personBudget;
   ```

2. **Relationship Integrity:**
   ```java
   // PersonId ensures referential integrity
   List<PersonId> participants = event.getParticipants();
   // Relationships persist across person edits
   ```

3. **Observable Lists:**
   ```java
   ObservableList<Person> getFilteredPersonList();
   ObservableList<Event> getFilteredEventList();
   // UI automatically updates when data changes
   ```

The Model is completely independent of UI and Storage components, following clean architecture principles.

### Storage Component

**API**: [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

**Storage Architecture:**

* `StorageManager`: Coordinates between AddressBook and UserPrefs storage
* `JsonAddressBookStorage`: Persists dual-entity data in JSON format
* `JsonUserPrefsStorage`: Manages user preferences and settings

**JSON Adapters:**
* `JsonAdaptedPerson`: Serializes Person objects with PersonId preservation
* `JsonAdaptedEvent`: Handles Event serialization with participant relationships
* `JsonAdaptedTag`: Manages tag serialization
* `JsonSerializableAddressBook`: Root container for complete data export/import

**Key Storage Features:**

1. **Automatic Saving**: Data persists after every state-changing command
2. **Graceful Recovery**: Handles corrupted files by reverting to sample data
3. **Relationship Preservation**: PersonId references maintained across sessions
4. **User Preferences**: Window size, position, and view preferences saved

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes noteworthy implementation details of key features.

### Budget Management System

#### Overview

AbsolutSin-ema implements sophisticated budget tracking for both individual vendors and events. This system ensures financial constraints are respected when assigning vendors to events.

#### Implementation

**Budget Components:**
* `Budget` class: Validates and stores monetary values
* Event budget tracking: Initial vs. remaining budget separation
* Person budget: Service cost for vendor assignments

**Budget Validation Algorithm:**
```java
public void validateAssignment(Person person, Event event) {
    double personCost = Double.parseDouble(person.getBudget().value);
    double remainingBudget = Double.parseDouble(event.getRemainingBudget().value);

    if (remainingBudget < personCost) {
        throw new CommandException("Budget exceeded");
    }
}
```

**Budget Updates:**
When assigning contacts to events, the system:
1. Validates each person's cost against remaining budget
2. Updates remaining budget after successful assignment
3. Prevents over-budget assignments
4. Maintains budget history for undo operations

#### Design Considerations

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Real-time budget validation
* Pros: Immediate feedback, prevents budget violations
* Cons: More complex assignment logic

**Alternative 2:** Post-assignment budget checking
* Pros: Simpler implementation
* Cons: Could allow budget violations

### Event-Person Assignment System

#### Overview

The assignment system manages complex relationships between vendors and events with budget constraints and participant tracking.

#### Implementation

**Assignment Command Flow:**
1. `AssignContactToEventCommand` receives event index and person indexes
2. Validates all indexes against current filtered lists
3. Checks for existing assignments to prevent duplicates
4. Validates budget constraints for each assignment
5. Updates event with new participants and adjusted budget
6. Saves state for undo functionality

**Key Implementation Details:**

```java
// Collect and validate persons with budget checking
private List<Person> collectAndValidatePersons(List<Person> lastShownList,
        Event eventToModify, double eventBudget) throws CommandException {
    List<Person> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for (Index i : assignedPersonIndexList) {
        Person personToAdd = lastShownList.get(i.getZeroBased());
        double personBudget = parseBudgetSafe(personToAdd.getBudget().value);

        if (eventBudget < personBudget) {
            throw new CommandException("Budget exceeded for " + personToAdd.getName());
        }
        eventBudget -= personBudget;
        result.add(personToAdd);
    }
    return result;
}
```

**Assignment Features:**
* Bulk assignment: Multiple contacts in single command (`assign 1 c/2,3,4`)
* Budget validation: Automatic checking during assignment
* Duplicate prevention: Cannot assign same person multiple times
* State preservation: Full undo support for assignments

### Undo System Implementation

#### Overview

AbsolutSin-ema implements a state-saving undo system that captures application state before destructive operations.

#### Implementation

**State Management:**
```java
// Before executing state-changing command
model.saveStateForUndo("description of operation");

// Execute operation
performOperation();

// Undo restores previous state
model.undo(); // Restores to saved state
```

**Undo-Capable Commands:**
* Person management: `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `clear`
* Event management: `addp`, `deletep`, `editp`
* Assignments: `assign`, `unassign`

**State Saving Strategy:**
* Deep copy of entire AddressBook before modification
* Operation description for user feedback
* Single-level undo (most recent operation only)

#### Design Considerations

**Current Implementation:**
* Pros: Simple and reliable
* Cons: Memory intensive for large datasets

**Alternative Approach:** Command-specific undo
* Pros: Memory efficient
* Cons: Complex implementation, higher error potential

### Search and Filter System

#### Overview

Advanced search capabilities supporting both name-based and tag-based filtering across persons and events.

#### Implementation

**Search Components:**
* `FindCommand`: Unified search across name and tag fields
* `NameAndTagContainsKeywordsPredicate`: Advanced filtering logic
* Real-time result updates in UI

**Search Algorithm:**
```java
public boolean test(Person person) {
    // Name matching (case-insensitive)
    boolean nameMatch = keywords.stream()
        .anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(
            person.getName().fullName, keyword));

    // Tag matching
    boolean tagMatch = person.getTags().stream()
        .anyMatch(tag -> keywords.stream()
            .anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(
                tag.tagName, keyword)));

    return nameMatch || tagMatch;
}
```

**Search Features:**
* Multi-keyword support: `find john caterer` matches name OR tag
* Case-insensitive matching
* Partial word matching
* Tag-specific searching: `find caterer` shows all caterers
* Real-time filtering with immediate UI updates

   2. Exit and restart application
   3. **Expected**: All changes preserved exactly as made.

### Error handling

1. **Invalid command formats**
   1. Test case: `add` (missing parameters)
   2. **Expected**: Usage message showing correct command format.

   3. Test case: `assign` (missing parameters)
   4. **Expected**: Usage message for assign command.

   5. Test case: `invalidcommand`
   6. **Expected**: Error message indicating unknown command.

2. **Index boundary testing**
   1. Prerequisites: Note the current list sizes for vendors and events
   2. Test case: `delete 0`, `delete [size+1]`, `assign 0 c/1`, `assign 1 c/0`
   3. **Expected**: Appropriate error messages for each invalid index scenario.

These test cases cover the major functionality of AbsolutSin-ema. Testers should also explore edge cases, rapid command sequences, and integration scenarios to ensure robust operation.

### Major Enhancements

#### 1. Dual-Entity Architecture (High Effort)

**Challenge**: Extending from single-entity (Person) to dual-entity (Person + Event) system
**Implementation Effort**:
- Created complete Event model with EventName, EventDate, EventTime classes
- Developed UniqueEventList with duplicate detection and management
- Modified AddressBook to handle both entities simultaneously
- Updated Storage layer to persist both entities in JSON format
- Enhanced UI to display both persons and events effectively

**Lines of Code**: ~800 additional lines across model, storage, and UI layers

#### 2. Event-Person Relationship Management (High Effort)

**Challenge**: Creating robust many-to-many relationships between vendors and events
**Implementation Effort**:
- Designed PersonId system for stable relationship references
- Built assignment commands (assign/unassign) with bulk operations
- Implemented relationship integrity checks and validation
- Created participant tracking within events
- Developed UI components to display relationships

**Complexity**: Managing bidirectional relationships while maintaining data integrity required careful design and extensive testing.

#### 3. Budget Management System (Medium-High Effort)

**Challenge**: Real-time budget tracking and validation across assignments
**Implementation Effort**:
- Added Budget class with validation and arithmetic operations
