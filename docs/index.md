AbsolutSin-ema is an address book that is designed as a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AbsolutSin-ema can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
